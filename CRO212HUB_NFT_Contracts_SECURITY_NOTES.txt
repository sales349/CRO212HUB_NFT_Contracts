# SECURITY NOTES – CRO212HUB Smart Contracts

Project: CRO212HUB – NFT Generator and Launchpad  
Repo: CRO212HUB_NFT_Contracts  
File: SECURITY_NOTES.md  
Owner: TO FILL IN BY DEV (name, GitHub handle)  
Last updated: TO FILL IN BY DEV (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Purpose

This file defines security expectations for the **smart contracts** used by the CRO212HUB NFT Generator and Launchpad on Cronos.

These contracts will handle:
- Minting NFTs.
- Supply limits.
- Revenue splitting between wallets.
- Optional whitelist logic.

They must NOT contain any hidden backdoors or unexpected behaviors.

If code and this document differ, the difference must be fixed.

## 1. Contract Types and Roles

Planned contracts:
- Main ERC 721 style NFT collection contract template.
- Optional helper contracts if needed (for whitelist, payment split, etc).

Admin / Owner roles:
- Owner / Admin functions must be clearly named and documented.
- Admin powers may include:
  - Setting base URI.
  - Pausing and unpausing mint (if implemented).
  - Updating mint price (if agreed).
  - Withdrawing funds according to the revenue split.

Admin powers must NOT include:
- Draining user funds beyond what is paid as mint price.
- Arbitrarily changing balances of already minted tokens.

Any special roles (for example, platform owner) must be documented here:

## 2. Revenue Split Rules

The mint contract will include a revenue split between named wallets, for example:
- Project treasury wallet.
- CRO212HUB platform wallet.
- Optional additional wallet (LP, community, etc).

Rules:
- The revenue split logic must be visible and readable in the contract.
- No hidden extra wallets or shadow percentages.
- Any wallet addresses used for revenue must:
  - Be either constructor parameters or clear constants.
  - Be documented in comments.

If upgradeable patterns are used (proxy, etc), this must be:
- 100 percent documented.
- Accepted by the project owner in advance.

---

## 3. Supply and Minting Rules

The contract must enforce:
- A clear `maxSupply`.
- Optional `maxPerWallet` or similar per address limit.
- Mint price in CRO.

Rules:
- Minting should revert if:
  - maxSupply would be exceeded.
  - maxPerWallet would be exceeded.
  - Not enough CRO is sent.
- If whitelist minting is implemented:
  - The whitelist logic must be simple and visible (for example Merkle tree, standard pattern).
  - No secret “bypass” for specific addresses.

---

## 4. Hidden Behavior and Backdoors

The contracts must NOT contain:
- Functions that send funds to unlisted wallets.
- Undocumented owner-only functions that:
  - Transfer all NFTs away from users.
  - Change ownership to a hard-coded address.
  - Disable transfers permanently without clear reason.

Any “emergency” or “rescue” function must:
- Be clearly named (for example `emergencyWithdraw`, `rescueTokens`).
- Be documented in comments with an explanation of when and how it is expected to be used.

---

## 5. Deployment and Networks

Target network:
- Cronos testnet first.
- Later Cronos mainnet when ready.

The developer must:
- Provide clear deployment scripts or instructions.
- Document the testnet contract addresses in this file once deployed:

Testnet contract addresses:
- TO FILL IN BY DEV

Mainnet contract addresses (when deployed later):
- TO FILL IN BY DEV

## 6. Auditing and Changes

Any major change to:
- Revenue split logic
- Supply rules
- Admin powers

Must be:
- Documented here in a short note.
- Communicated to the project owner.

Known security notes and decisions:
